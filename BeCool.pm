=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module automatically uses the top ten things returned by a CPAN
search for "cool," or uses what you tell it.  Use it to keep up with
the latest fads in Perl development, or to try to become a Perl
trend-setter yourself!  Note that it doesn't try to install anything
you don't already have, because if you're cool, you already have it.
